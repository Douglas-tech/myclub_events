# myclub_events

One of my tasks that I completed in my studies of software engineering.
This site will show the user which events are happening on which date, location and who will be attending. 
It also allows a user to register, then once registered it enables the user to upload an event with times and dates, modify the event
and delete the event if needed. Only the logged in user can make those updates, but any user can see all events.
